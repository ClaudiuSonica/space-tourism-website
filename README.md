### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flex-box
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- ES6 Javascript

### What I learned

I used this experience to learn more about grid and it's use in responsive and easy layouts.
I also learned about hover states, focus states, active states and animations.
I also used media queries to adjust the layout to mobile and desktop sizes.
I also used ES6 Javascript to add functionalities to the tabs.
